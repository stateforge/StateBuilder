StateBuilder
============

This project contains the source code of a C++ and Java state machine code generator named *StateBuilderCpp* and *StateBuilderJava*.

From an XML state machine description file, they produce a C++ or Java source code implementation using an extended version of the state pattern.

The XML state machine description can be authored with the [web based state diagram editor](http://www.stateforge.com/StateMachineDiagram/StateMachineDiagram.html)

Please visit [StateForge](http://www.stateforge.com) for more information about the various state machine tools.
